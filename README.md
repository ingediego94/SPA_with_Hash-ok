## SPA with hash
This project contains the general structure to create a new project with Single Page Application (SPA) using hash.

Special notations:
- index.html is the unique page with the complete structure of html, the rest of views only have sections of fragments of html, therefore, styles from css of Bootstrap or logic writen in JS should be contained in index.html.
- All views must be contained within the called folder "views", this for the current and new "views.html".
